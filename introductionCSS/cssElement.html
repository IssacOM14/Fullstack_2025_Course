<!--CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, a cascade its pretty much a waterfall, we have a level and drops down to another level. The style starts from the most general all the way down to
to the most specific style requierements. The Style Sheet means a type of language similar to HTML, the SS is a language to specify how things should look in our website. We also have
Sass or Less. THe most important one is CSS.-->

<!--Back in the old days, devs were limited by HTML. In order to control what our documents look like was the creation of CSS. The W3C release in 1995 the HTML 3.2 allowed new tags like the font, color or face
we also have the size, the center etc. Defined how to the layout will be seen on the screen. All of these are deprecated elements, because HTML is suppose to be about content.-->

<!-- In 1996 there was a recommendation aout CSS, that allows us style to HTML. We separated the structure (content) and the style. The mondularity is important in programming. -->
