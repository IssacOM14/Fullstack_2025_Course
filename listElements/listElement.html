    <!-- Unordered List -->
    <!-- We simply have a starting tag with "ul" and a closing tag, normally we have one-line element. For example <h1> This is one-line element </h1> -->
    <!-- Now, with the unordered list its a little bit different, the content will be in separated lines because in between this opening and closing tags we need
    an extra type of tag to complete the unordered list called "list item" -->

    <!-- The list item is represented by the "li" tag, so we have to open and close this tag for each item we want to add to the unordered list. Each one of these 
    has its own content. Since it is an unordered list the content will have bullet points. In this context, we can say that a shopping list is a unordered list
    the order of the list does not matter. -->

    <!-- Example of an unordered list -->
    <ul>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- Ordered List -->
    <!-- On the other hand, we have the ordered list, that is similar to the unordered list, but the difference is that the order of the items matters. The ordered list is represented by 
    the "ol" tag, and each item is still represented by the "li" tag. In this case, the items will be numbered instead of having bullet points, starting from 1. 
    An example of an ordered list is a ranking of movies, where the order is significant. -->
    <ol>
        <li>Go to the supermarket</li>
        <li>Get the cart</li>
        <li>Get the items</li>
    </ol>
