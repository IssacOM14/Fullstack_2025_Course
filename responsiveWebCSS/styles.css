We want our website to look good on all devices, so we use responsive web design 
techniques in this CSS file. 
This includes flexible grid layouts, media queries, and fluid images to ensure that our content adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations.

So when a user accesses our site from a mobile phone, tablet, or desktop computer, they have an optimal viewing experience.

We have the four main ways to do this:
1. Media Queries
2. CSS Grid
3. CSS Flexbox
4. External Frameworks (like Bootstrap or Foundation)

Example of Media Query:
@media (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
        background-color: lightblue;
    }
}
In this case, when the screen width is 600 pixels or less, the background color of the body changes to light blue.

With the CSS Grid is a little more difficult to understand, but here is a simple example:
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
    gap: 10px;
}
In this example, the container will create a grid layout that automatically adjusts the number of columns based on the available space, with each column being at least 200 pixels wide.
This ensures that the layout remains flexible and responsive across different screen sizes.


Flexbox is another powerful layout module that allows for responsive design. Here’s a basic example:
.navbar {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: space-between;
}
In this example, the navbar will use flexbox to arrange its items. The flex-wrap property allows the items to wrap onto multiple lines if necessary, and justify-content ensures that there is space between the items.


The main difference between Grid and Flexbox is that Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts (both rows and columns), while Flexbox is intended for one-dimensional layouts (either a row or a column).
Finally, we have external frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation that provide pre-built responsive components and grid systems, making it easier to create responsive designs without writing all the CSS from scratch.
The framework is not something that is build into CSS itself, but rather a collection of CSS and JavaScript files that you can include in your project.
