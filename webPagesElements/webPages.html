        <!-- We know that we have a fodler that contains our main html file called index.html and then we can also have some folders within the main one, for example, the images folder.
        but in order to create a multi-page website, what we'll need is multiple-pages. One can be about contact, another one is about us etc. All of these will be on the same project folder.

        <!--We know that we need to use the "src" attribute when we need to access the image from a path and not the "href" attribute. But we can also use the technique known as nesting.
        That is to say, we can add an image element within the anchor element, for example, we have the following code:
        <a href="www.ourwebsite.com"><img src="img.png" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;"></a> in this code, we can click the image and we will get into a website -->
